Interpretable machine learning model: Inherently concept whitening music genre categorization &amp; low-level conceptualization
This dissertation presents a comprehensive investigation into the application of machine learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in the field of music genre classification using vinyl album covers. Leveraging the latest advancements in deep learning and computer vision, the study introduces two models: one employing batch normalization and another utilizing Concept Whitening (CW) techniques to enhance model interpretability.

The main objectives are to evaluate these models' classification accuracy and interpretability. Using robust evaluation parameters, both models exhibit good accuracy rates in classifying music genres based on vinyl album covers. Notably, the concept whitening model adds another layer of interpretability, unraveling the black-box features found in standard neural networks. Empirical findings indicate that concept whitening not only enhances model interpretability but also competes effectively in terms of predictive performance.

This project serves in the pursuit of reliable and transparent image-based music genre classification systems. By comparing the two models on both accuracy and interpretability fronts, the study shines a light on the viability of incorporating concept whitening into standard CNN architectures for more explainable AI applications.
